# kolmogorov-flow
Fortran code used in paralel processor to simulate the velocity distributed in 2-d planes of a fluid flow forced with an external sinusoid. 
This is the code that generates 2-d flow velocities for the Kolmogorov flow, defined as a two dimensional and unidirectional shear flow 
with a sinusoidal mean velocity profile. A. Kolmogorovâ€™s intent was to study and understand the transitions and complexities of turbulence 
in addition to the energy cascading process.
